{% capture billboard_description %}

Spring Cloud Task allows a user to develop and run short lived microservices using Spring Cloud and run them locally, or in the cloud, or even on Spring Cloud Data Flow. Just add `@EnableTask` and run your app as a Spring Boot app (single application context).

## Quick Start

{% include download_widget.md %}

As long as Spring Cloud Task is on the classpath any Spring Boot application with `@EnableTask` will record the start and finish of the boot application as well as any uncaught exceptions in the configured task repository. Sample application:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableTask
public class ExampleApplication {

	@Bean
	public CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner() {
		return strings ->
				System.out.println("Executed at :" + 
				      new SimpleDateFormat().format(new Date()));
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(ExampleApplication.class, args);
	}
}
```
{% endcapture %}
